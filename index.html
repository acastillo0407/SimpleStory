      <p>Yes, you read that right. <br><br>
         You can potentially add some spicy new details to the original myth. You will be embarking on the journey, which relates to the myth, that we all know to love and care for. You will be put in scenarios that relate to what Antigone had to tackle. Thus, based on what you choose will determine your ending. At the end, I will always tell you what actually happend in the myth (so stick around until the end). Be advised, punishment may just be lurking around if you pick the wrong (or right!) choice. Or hey, maybe you don't care. Maybe you didn't even read this text and you already entered your name and selected start. Maybe. Maybe Not. </p>
